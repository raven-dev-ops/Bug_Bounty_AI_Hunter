## Summary
Talk focused on AI "shadow data" exposure paths with emphasis on privacy and
cryptography. It highlights fine-tuning, RAG, prompt context, and logs as
primary leakage surfaces.

## Relevance to the project
- Defines where private data sits in AI apps (indexes, prompts, logs).
- Calls out system prompt and RAG context exposure risks.
- Emphasizes logging and retention implications.

## Notable segments
- 10:36-13:41 RAG overview and shadow data inventory.
- 13:41-15:37 Logging and retention implications.
- 15:46-17:34 System prompt and context leakage patterns.

## Planned artifacts
- Cards: shadow data inventory, system prompt exposure, RAG context leakage,
  logging retention risk.
- Checklist: RAG and logging review.
