# Sources

Place source materials and short source notes here. Keep originals unchanged
when possible, and add separate notes for summaries or extraction planning.

Conventions:
- Raw sources can be stored as `NAME.md` (no frontmatter required).
- Add a matching `NAME.source.md` with frontmatter so it can be indexed and
  referenced from cards and checklists.
