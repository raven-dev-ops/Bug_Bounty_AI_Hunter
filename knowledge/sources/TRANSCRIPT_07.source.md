## Summary
Short talk on early bug bounty mistakes and the habits that improve outcomes:
scope discipline, structured recon, impact-first focus, and clear reporting.

## Relevance to the project
- Reinforces ROE-first thinking: scope, rules, and "do not" lists come first.
- Highlights why notes, reproducibility, and report quality affect outcomes.
- Useful as a workflow baseline before applying AI-assisted pipelines.

## Notable segments
- 0:34 preparation over hype; scope and program rules
- 1:04 tools vs understanding; scanners and false positives
- 1:23 recon depth; patterns, responses, and obsessive notes
- 2:40 scope creep; prioritize impact over novelty
- 2:53 reporting quality; screenshots and step-by-step reproduction
- 3:29 reflection and iteration; learn from failures and community
