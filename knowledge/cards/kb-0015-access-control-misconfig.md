## Summary
Legacy access control systems can drift into overly broad permissions or mismatched policy layers.

## Relevance to the project
Supports reviews of least privilege and policy alignment in legacy environments.

## Safe notes
- Review both file permissions and external security manager rules.
- Audit for broad read/write access to sensitive data sets.
- Normalize policy sources to avoid conflicting controls.
- Record and review privileged role assignments.
