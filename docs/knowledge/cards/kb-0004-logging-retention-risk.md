## Summary
Prompt logs and retrieval context often include sensitive data. Retention and
access practices can turn logs into an unintended data store.

## Relevance to the project
- Drives logging review and retention safeguards.
- Informs evidence capture and minimal data handling.

## Safe notes
- Minimize prompt and context logging where possible.
- Apply redaction and strict access controls for retained logs.
- Set short retention periods and document legal/compliance constraints.
- Treat log export and analysis pipelines as sensitive data flows.
