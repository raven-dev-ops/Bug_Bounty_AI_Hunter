# Path: Threat Model Only

This path is for teams that only need a threat model and test plan.

## Steps
1. Collect scope and system details (`TARGET_PROFILE.md`).
2. Generate a dataflow map (`PIPELINE.md`) or document manually.
3. Produce a threat model with assumptions and mitigations (`THREAT_MODEL.md`).
4. Share outputs for review and approvals.

## Helpful references
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` for system boundaries.
- `ROE.md` for constraints and stop conditions.
