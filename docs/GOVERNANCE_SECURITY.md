# Governance and Security

This document outlines the responsible disclosure workflow for this project.

## Reporting workflow
- Use the program's official disclosure channel.
- Provide a clear summary, impact, and minimal reproduction steps.
- Include only redacted evidence and safe artifacts.

## Coordination
- Acknowledge receipt within 2 business days.
- Agree on a remediation timeline with the program owner.
- Avoid public disclosure until the owner confirms resolution.

## Data handling
- Store raw evidence outside the repo with encryption at rest.
- Limit access to authorized team members only.
- Keep a chain-of-custody record for critical evidence.

## Legal and policy alignment
- Follow `docs/ROE.md` and program scope.
- Do not test out-of-scope assets.
- Pause if authorization is unclear.
