# Changelog Policy

Use this policy to keep release notes consistent.

## Structure
- Keep an `Unreleased` section at the top.
- Group changes by theme when possible.
- Use short, action-oriented bullet points.

## Content rules
- Document user-facing changes and schema updates.
- Note new scripts, docs, and examples.
- Avoid speculative or unverified claims.

## Release process
- Move items from `Unreleased` into the versioned release section.
- Include the release date in ISO format.
