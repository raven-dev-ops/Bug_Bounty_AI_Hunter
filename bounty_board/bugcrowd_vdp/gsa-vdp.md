Through our Public Buildings Service, Federal Acquisition Service, and various staff offices, we provide workspace to more than 1 million federal civilian workers, oversee the preservation of more than 480 historic buildings, and facilitate the federal government's purchase of high-quality, low-cost goods and services from reliable commercial vendors.
