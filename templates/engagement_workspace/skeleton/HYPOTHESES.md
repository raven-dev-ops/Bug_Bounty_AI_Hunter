# Hypotheses: {{platform}} / {{slug}}

Write hypotheses in plain language and tie them to evidence.

## Backlog
Keep checks safe and scoped. Prefer canaries and documentation review before any
interactive testing.

| ID | Hypothesis | Why it might be true | What to check (safe) | Signal | Stop conditions | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H-001 | <plain language hypothesis> | <rationale> | <safe check> | <expected signal> | <stop conditions> | backlog |

## Notes
- Link evidence IDs and timestamps when a hypothesis becomes a finding.
- If scope is unclear, stop and confirm rules before continuing.
