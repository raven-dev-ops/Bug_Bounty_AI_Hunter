# Engagement Workspace Template

This template is a lightweight folder layout for engagement notes, recon logs,
and report drafts.

Recommended usage:
- Run: `python -m scripts.init_engagement_workspace --platform bugcrowd --slug <slug>`
- Or copy: `templates/engagement_workspace/skeleton/` into your workspace.

Template tree:
- `RECON_LOG.md` (primary running log)
- `ENDPOINTS.md` (endpoint map)
- `HYPOTHESES.md` (what to test next and why)
- `REPORT_DRAFT.md` (draft report structure)
- `evidence/README.md` (what to store and what to avoid)

Notes:
- Keep content safe and non-weaponized.
- Follow `docs/ROE.md` and the program rules.
