# Contributing

Thanks for improving the report and supporting docs.

## What to contribute
- Typos, clarity fixes, and structure improvements
- Link updates and corrections
- New references with authoritative sources

## How to propose changes
1. Open an issue describing the change and the page or section.
2. Include the exact replacement text and the source link.
3. If you can, attach a marked-up PDF or a list of edits.

If you cannot edit the PDF source directly, use issues to suggest edits and
maintainers will publish an updated PDF.

## Style
- Keep the tone professional and practical.
- Avoid advice that could encourage testing without authorization.
- Use ASCII characters in Markdown.
