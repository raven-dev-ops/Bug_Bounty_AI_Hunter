# Repository Context

This repository is a docs-first hub for AI bug bounty workflows.
It contains guidance, schemas, examples, and local automation scripts.
Only test targets you own or have written authorization to test.

## Where to start
- `README.md` for install notes and CLI examples.
- `dashboard.html` for a local interactive repo overview.
- `docs/index.md` for the MkDocs entry point.
- `docs/ROE.md` for authorization and safety rules.
- `docs/PIPELINE.md` for the plan/run workflow.
- `docs/REPORTING.md` for report bundles and exports.

## Repo layout (high level)
- `dashboard.html` and `dashboard/` local dashboard (static HTML/CSS/JS).
- `docs/` published documentation (MkDocs source).
- `knowledge/` curated sources, cards, and checklists (source of truth).
- `schemas/` JSONSchema for artifacts and inputs.
- `scripts/` automation modules (invoked via `python -m scripts.<module>`).
- `examples/` sample inputs and outputs.
- `templates/` report and engagement workspace templates.
- `bounty_board/` planning-only program boards (public metadata only).

## Generated files (do not hand-edit)
- `knowledge/INDEX.md` is generated by `python -m scripts.knowledge_index --output knowledge/INDEX.md`.
- `docs/KNOWLEDGE_INDEX.md` and `docs/knowledge/` are generated by `python -m scripts.publish_knowledge_docs`.
- `docs/COVERAGE_MATRIX.md` is generated from `docs/coverage_matrix.yaml` by `python -m scripts.coverage_matrix`.
- `data/component_registry_index.json` is generated by `python -m scripts.component_registry_index`.
- `site/` is generated by MkDocs.

Root docs duplicated into `docs/` for MkDocs:
- `BUGCROWD.md` -> `docs/BUGCROWD.md`
- `GUIDE.md` -> `docs/GUIDE.md`
Sync with `python -m scripts.sync_mkdocs_copies`.

## Local checks
- Run CI-style checks locally with `python -m scripts.check_all` (use `--fast` to skip slower steps).
- CI also enforces ASCII-only Markdown and validates Markdown links.

## Safety and confidentiality
- Follow `docs/ROE.md` and the target program rules.
- Keep content safe and non-weaponized.
- Do not commit secrets. Use `.env.example` as the template.
- PDFs and most generated outputs are intentionally ignored by git.

## Maintainer notes
- See `AGENTS.md` for repo-specific agent instructions.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` when docs or structure change.
