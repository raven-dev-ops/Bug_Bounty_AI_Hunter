# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## Unreleased
- Added Command Center backend MVP baseline with FastAPI endpoints, SQLite persistence schema, and artifact ingestion from `data/program_registry.json`, `data/findings_db.json`, and `bounty_board/` (issues #168, #169, #170, #171).
- Added `command-center/` React + TypeScript + Tailwind scaffold with routed pages, responsive app shell navigation, command palette skeleton, and dark-yellow theme tokens with a switcher (issues #165, #166, #167).
- Updated `scripts/bootstrap_issues.sh` to use the correct default repo, require `gh` auth up front, and support overriding the target with `GITHUB_REPO`.
- Corrected command-center triage tracking: issue `#164` stays closed (ADR delivered), while issues `#165`-`#206` remain open in `status/ready` until delivery completion.
- Streamlined CI to reduce redundant checks: linting, docs/link validation, and dependency audit now run once on Python 3.11, while the 3.10-3.12 matrix focuses on unit tests (coverage stays on 3.11).
- Added `docs/ADR_COMMAND_CENTER_ARCHITECTURE.md` to document issue #164 with a staged SPA + API + worker architecture mapped to existing schemas and scripts.
- Seeded GitHub issues (#164-#206) for the command-center redesign backlog.
- Added `docs/COMMAND_CENTER_TRIAGE.md` to complete triage acceptance criteria for command-center backlog issues (#164-#206).
- Added `dashboard.html` plus `dashboard/` assets for a local interactive repo overview (knowledge, tools, bounties, sponsor profiles, leaderboards, registry, artifacts).
- Enhanced the dashboard bounties view with a "Most Wanted" carousel, sponsor website icon support, and Level (P0-P4) tagging/filtering.
- Simplified the dashboard navigation into page-style views and added a Docs "forum" view (from `mkdocs.yml`) plus a live workflow tracker (from `data/workflow_tracker.json`).
- Completed unfinished docs/templates: filled `docs/RELEASE_NOTES_TEMPLATE.md`, added missing template READMEs (`templates/reporting/README.md`, `templates/platforms/README.md`), refreshed engagement workspace skeleton templates, and promoted curated knowledge items to `reviewed` with regenerated indexes.
- Normalized generated Markdown/JSON writers to emit LF line endings (reduces CRLF churn on Windows).
- Updated `CONTEXT.md` to reflect current repo structure, generated files, and local checks.
- Expanded `CONTRIBUTING.md` with safety rules, generated-file guidance, and local check commands.
- Added `python -m scripts.sync_mkdocs_copies` plus CI/local checks to keep `docs/BUGCROWD.md` and `docs/GUIDE.md` in sync with root docs.
- Added `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` to standardize safety and generated-file checks for PRs.
- Made the Bugcrowd brief exporter public-first with optional auth fallback and added `--public-only` and `--auth-required` flags (`python -m scripts.bugcrowd_briefs`).
- Published curated knowledge items into MkDocs (`docs/knowledge/`, `docs/KNOWLEDGE_INDEX.md`) and added a CI sync check (`python -m scripts.publish_knowledge_docs`).
- Added a one-command local check runner that mirrors CI (`python -m scripts.check_all`).
- Added Transcript 07 source notes and a bug bounty starter workflow checklist (`knowledge/sources/TRANSCRIPT_07.md`, `knowledge/checklists/bug-bounty-starter-workflow.md`).
- Clarified raw source handling in knowledge format docs and added `python -m scripts.knowledge_lint` to CI.
- Added engagement workspace templates and a scaffold script for recon notes and report drafts (`templates/engagement_workspace/`, `python -m scripts.init_engagement_workspace`).
- Added MkDocs page for the bug bounty starter workflow checklist (`docs/BUG_BOUNTY_STARTER_WORKFLOW.md`).
- Expanded MkDocs navigation to include all docs under `docs/`.
- Added Bugcrowd VDP bounty board outputs under `bounty_board/bugcrowd_vdp/` (`python -m scripts.bugcrowd_board --category vdp --combined --all-pages --out-dir bounty_board/bugcrowd_vdp`).
- Added MkDocs docs copies and navigation entries for `BUGCROWD.md` and `GUIDE.md` (`docs/BUGCROWD.md`, `docs/GUIDE.md`).
- Added Bugcrowd auth-only brief exporter (`python -m scripts.bugcrowd_briefs`) that writes local outputs under gitignored `bounty_board/bugcrowd_full/` with a `.env.example` template for credentials.
- Added rendered brief/scope sections for Bugcrowd auth-only brief exports plus a local postprocessor (`python -m scripts.bugcrowd_full_postprocess`) to retrofit existing exports and generate `bounty_board/bugcrowd_full/INDEX.md`.
- Enforced LF line endings for key text files via `.gitattributes` to reduce CRLF churn across platforms.
- Updated testing docs to make `unittest` the default runner and keep `pytest` optional.
- Added Bugcrowd researcher operating policy and pre-report guide docs (`BUGCROWD.md`, `GUIDE.md`).
