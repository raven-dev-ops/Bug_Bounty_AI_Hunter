# AGENTS

Project type: documentation only. PDFs are managed outside git.

## Working notes
- Treat PDFs as binary artifacts. Update only with approved source edits.
- Do not commit PDFs; they are ignored.
- If you extract text for review, use a temporary file and delete it before
  finishing.
- Keep Markdown in ASCII and keep sentences concise.
- When the report changes, update `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- No build or test steps are required.
