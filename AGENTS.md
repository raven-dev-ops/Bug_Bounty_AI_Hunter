# AGENTS

Project type: docs-first planning repo. PDFs are managed outside git.

## Working notes
- Treat PDFs as binary artifacts. Update only with approved source edits.
- Do not commit PDFs; they are ignored.
- If you extract text for review, use a temporary file and delete it before
  finishing.
- Keep Markdown in ASCII and keep sentences concise.
- When docs or structure change, update `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- No build or test steps are required yet.
- Follow `docs/ROE.md` when drafting safety guidance.
- Follow `docs/KNOWLEDGE_FORMAT.md` for knowledge cards and sources.
